My wife said I needed to do this one in Java to be able to sleep on the couch again.
## Setup ##

Since this was the first time for me working with Java in VSCode; using its
extensions would require me to structure this as a Gradle project. Hence
having ech days applications stored in the `src/main/java` directory.

To build a single day and part, run the following command from the root
directory.

$ javac src/main/java/Day1.java
